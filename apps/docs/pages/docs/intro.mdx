# Introduction

Beautifully designed advanced components that extends the shadcn's ui which you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

This is **NOT** shadcn ui. Some components were created using the shadcn's ui components.

**What do you mean by not a component library?**

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.
